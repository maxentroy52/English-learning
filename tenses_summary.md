### **Notes**:
- **Aspect vs. Tense**: While English technically has only two morphological tenses (past and present), future time is expressed using modal verbs (e.g., *will*). The 12-tense framework combines time with aspect for clarity.
- **Stative Verbs**: Verbs like *know*, *love*, or *belong* typically avoid continuous forms (e.g., "I know," not "I am knowing").
- **Signal Words**: Look for adverbs like *now* (continuous), *already* (perfect), or *by tomorrow* (future perfect).

Okay, the user is asking how many tenses there are in English and wants an explanation of each. Let me start by recalling what I know about English tenses. I remember that traditionally, there are 12 main tenses, which are combinations of the past, present, and future with the simple, continuous, perfect, and perfect continuous aspects. But I should make sure that's accurate.

Wait, sometimes people get confused between tenses and aspects. Tenses refer to time (past, present, future), and aspects refer to how the action is viewed (simple, continuous, perfect, perfect continuous). So combining the three times with the four aspects gives 12 tenses. That seems right.

Let me list them out: present simple, present continuous, present perfect, present perfect continuous; past simple, past continuous, past perfect, past perfect continuous; future simple, future continuous, future perfect, future perfect continuous. Yep, that's 12. But I should also check if some sources consider other structures, like the future with "going to," but I think those are considered part of the future tenses or as separate structures, not additional tenses.

Now, the user wants an explanation of each tense. For each one, I need to provide the structure, usage, and examples. Let's start with the present tenses. Present simple is for habits and general truths. Structure is subject + base verb (add 's' for third person). Example: "She works."

Present continuous is for ongoing actions now. Structure: subject + am/is/are + present participle. Example: "She is working."

Present perfect connects past actions to the present. Structure: subject + have/has + past participle. Example: "She has worked."

Present perfect continuous is for actions that started in the past and continue now. Structure: subject + have/has been + present participle. Example: "She has been working."

Then past tenses. Past simple for completed actions. Structure: subject + past tense verb. Example: "She worked."

Past continuous for ongoing actions in the past. Structure: subject + was/were + present participle. Example: "She was working."

Past perfect, which is the past of the past. Structure: subject + had + past participle. Example: "She had worked."

Past perfect continuous for actions ongoing up to a past point. Structure: subject + had been + present participle. Example: "She had been working."

Future tenses. Future simple for predictions or spontaneous decisions. Structure: subject + will + base verb. Example: "She will work."

Future continuous for ongoing actions in the future. Structure: subject + will be + present participle. Example: "She will be working."

Future perfect for actions completed before a future point. Structure: subject + will have + past participle. Example: "She will have worked."

Future perfect continuous for actions ongoing up to a future point. Structure: subject + will have been + present participle. Example: "She will have been working."

I should also note that sometimes "going to" is used for future plans, but it's not a separate tense. Maybe mention that in the future simple section. Also, check for common mistakes. For example, present perfect vs. past simple, or the use of continuous tenses for temporary actions.

Wait, the user might be a language learner, so clarity is key. Need to make sure examples are clear and each tense's usage is distinct. Also, maybe mention signal words like "already," "just," "yet" for present perfect, or "while" for past continuous.

Another thing: some sources mention fewer tenses, arguing that English only has two morphological tenses (past and present) and the rest are aspects or periphrastic constructions. But for teaching purposes, the 12-tense system is standard. Probably best to stick with the 12-tense explanation as it's widely taught.

Let me also think about the structure of the answer. Start by stating there are 12 tenses, grouped into past, present, future, each with four aspects. Then list each group, the tenses within, their structures, uses, examples. Maybe a summary table at the end.

Double-check the structures. For example, future perfect continuous is "will have been" plus present participle. Yes. Also, ensure that examples are correct and cover different subjects where necessary. Also, mention contractions like "I've" or "she's" where appropriate, but maybe keep examples simple.

I should also consider common errors. For instance, using present continuous with state verbs. E.g., "I am knowing" is incorrect. So maybe add a note about stative verbs not usually taking continuous forms. But perhaps that's beyond the scope of the question. The user asked for explanations of each tense, so maybe stick to the basics unless they ask for exceptions.

Okay, compiling all this into a clear, structured answer with each tense explained concisely. Make sure terminology is consistent. Use terms like "present participle" (verb+ing) and "past participle" (usually -ed for regular verbs). Also, note irregular verbs where necessary, but examples can use regular verbs for simplicity.

Finally, a summary table might help the user visualize all 12 tenses. Columns for Tense Name, Structure, Use, Example. That way, the information is easy to reference.

Wait, the user might appreciate knowing which tenses are most commonly used. For example, future perfect is less common in everyday speech. But again, maybe stick to the standard explanation unless the user specifies a need for frequency.

Also, consider the difference between British and American English. For example, present perfect vs. past simple in certain contexts. But perhaps that's too detailed unless the user asks.

In conclusion, the answer should list all 12 tenses with their structures, uses, and examples, organized by time and aspect. Keep explanations clear and examples straightforward. Avoid jargon where possible, but use necessary grammatical terms. Provide a summary table for quick reference.
